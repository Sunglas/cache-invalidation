The UPR-RP Asian Culture Festival is happening in 2 weeks from now.
All of us are finishing our preparations and starting our last finishing
practices for it.
One thing I noticed was that most of the pictures from last year were buried in
an instagram blogpost from last year.
Which is somewhat unfortunate since lots of beautiful pictures and moments were
created from that time.

What a better way to revive those memories and instill excitement in others than
with an online gallery of the Festival.
